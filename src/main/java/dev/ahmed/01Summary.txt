1. In order to realize network communication, three problems need to be solved:

- Question 1: How to accurately locate one or more hosts on the network
- Question 2: How to locate a specific application on the host
- Question 3: After finding the host, how to transmit data reliably and efficiently

2. Three elements to realize network transmission: (corresponding to solve three problems)

> Using IP addresses (to pinpoint one or more hosts on the network)
> use port number (target specific application on host)
> Standardize network communication protocols (reliable and efficient data transmission)

3. Communication element 1: IP address
3.1 Function
The IP address is used to uniquely number a computer device on the network

3.2 IP address classification
> IP address classification method 1
IPv4 (takes 4 bytes)
IPv6 (takes 16 bytes)

> IP address classification method 2
Public address (used by World Wide Web) and private address (used by LAN. Begins with 192.168)

3.3 Local loopback address: 127.0.0.1


3.4 Domain name: convenient to record ip address

4. Communication element 2: port number
> Can uniquely identify a process (application) in a host
> Different processes are assigned different port numbers
> Range: 0~65535


5. Use of InetAddress
5.1 Function
An instance of the InetAddress class represents a specific ip address.

5.2 Instantiation method
InetAddress getByName(String host): Get the instance of InetAddress corresponding to the specified ip
InetAddress getLocalHost(): Get the instance of InetAddress corresponding to the local ip


5.3 Common methods
getHostName()
getHostAddress()


6. Communication Element 3: Communication Protocol
6.1 Purpose of network communication protocol
In order to achieve reliable and efficient data transmission.

6.2 Network Reference Model
OSI reference model: The network is divided into 7 layers, which is too idealized and has not been implemented.
TCP/IP reference model: The network is divided into 4 layers: application layer, transport layer, network layer, physical + data link layer. de facto standard used.
